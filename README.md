=======================

These formulae are either under development or not available in the [core taps](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Interesting-Taps-&-Branches).

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap j1mr10rd4n/homebrew-tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from another tap, you can `brew install j1mr10rd4n/tap/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:


    brew install https://raw.github.com/j1mr10rd4n/homebrew-tap/master/<formula>.rb
